Right now, this adds a Meteor method that lets you create a new Meteor account by email. The [Drupal module](https://github.com/wizonesolutions/drupal-meteor-signup) uses this method to create new accounts.

**I want to develop this further, and the roadmap is wide open. Please open issues for the integration features you would like to see.**

I will be using this in [Spendflow](http://wiz1.us/spendflowbeta) eventually.

Thanks to [Project Ricochet](http://projectricochet.com) for allowing me to adapt and publish the code [Pushpin Planner](https://pushpinplanner.com) uses to create Meteor accounts from Drupal.
